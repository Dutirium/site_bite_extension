About

The "Crucial Sites" extension is a simple yet powerful browser add-on designed to help you quickly store and access your most important or frequently visited websites. Instead of cluttering your bookmarks or Browse history, this extension provides a dedicated, persistent list right in your browser's toolbar popup.
Features

    Quick Add: Easily add new website URLs directly from the extension's popup.
    Persistent Storage: All your crucial sites are saved using the browser's storage API, meaning they remain even after you close and reopen your browser.
    Instant Access: Click on any saved URL in the list to open it in a new tab.
    Easy Deletion: Remove sites from your list with a single click.
    Clean Interface: A straightforward and intuitive user interface for managing your links.
    Cross-Browser Compatible: Designed to work seamlessly across Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

Installation

Install the Crucial Sites extension directly from your browser's add-on store:

Usage

    Click the Crucial Sites extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
    In the popup, type the full URL of the website you want to save (e.g., https://www.google.com or wikipedia.org). The extension will try to prepend https:// if missing.
    Click the "Add" button or press Enter.
    The website will appear in your list.

    Click the "âœ–" button next to a site to remove it from your list.
